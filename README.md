# Survey form with React

A survey form created with React 

## The problem

A survey containing 4 questions:
- 2 text fields
- 1 drop down 
- 1 radio button
- A submit button, when pressed the app hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

If I had more time I would have added more questions and also made the answere "disapear" when clicking enter.
