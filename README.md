# Survey form with React

A survey form created with React that investigatesif you are our next stand-up comedian!

## The problem

The survey contains 4 questions:
- 2 text fields
- 1 drop down 
- 1 radio button
- A submit button, when pressed the app hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
 - The site follows accessibility guidelines

If I had more time I would have added more questions and also made the answere "disappear" when pressing enter.
